        Having one TV or Projector room per school limits the number of students
        & teachers than can simultaneously access digital content. Also children
        have to waste time in moving back & forth between Projector room &
        classroom. Having TV or projector in every classroom is very expensive
        for school & also a wastage of resources if not being used at any given
        time period.

        These limitations are solved in "TV On Wheels" program, where a TV mounted to a stand with wheels is rolled from one classroom to another. Teachers can show wide range of digital content in TV to the students in classroom.

        Tablets Behind Bars:

        A Tablet is placed in a case made of Iron bars,

        Iron case is locked with chain to a pillar in a school corridor

        This gives students, 24/7 access(Before school, lunch break, after school...) to high quality offline educational apps within the Tablet.

        Students can learn themselves or from other students in the absence of teacher.

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
