Having one TV or Projector room per school limits the number of students & teachers than can simultaneously access digital content. Also children have to waste time in moving back & forth between Projector room & classroom. Having TV or projector in every classroom is very expensive for school & also a wastage of resources if not being used at any given time period.

These limitations are solved in "TV On Wheels" program, where a TV mounted to a stand with wheels is rolled from one classroom to another. Teachers can show wide range of digital content in TV to the students in classroom.

* Teachers can use USB drive connected to TV & show educational videos, navigating the video through TV remote.
* Teachers can also cast their phone onto TV and show & interact with educational apps on the phone
* Educational CDs can be played in TV using a CD player or computer connected to TV, Everything mounted to TV stand
